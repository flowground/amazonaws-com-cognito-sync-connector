    "description": "Amazon Cognito Sync Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client\nlibrary that enable cross-device syncing of application-related user data.\nHigh-level client libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use\nthese libraries to persist data locally so that it's available even if the\ndevice is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile\ndevice to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized\nuser ID and credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up\nto 1 MB of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user\nidentity.\n\nWith Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible only\nto credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use the Cognito Sync\nservice, you need to make API calls using credentials retrieved with Amazon\nCognito Identity service\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html].\n\nIf you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will\nprobably want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the \nDeveloper Guide for Android\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html] \nand the Developer Guide for iOS\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-sync.html].",
